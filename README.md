# Polycast - Real-Time Language Learning Platform

A comprehensive language learning application that combines real-time transcription, translation, and spaced repetition flashcards with AI-powered content generation.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Flashcard Format Reference
**ALWAYS check this section when working on flashcards - the format is very specific!**

**FRONT of Card:**
1. English sentence with target word blanked out: "I will _____ into battle" 
2. Full translation with target word highlighted: "我将**冲锋**进入战斗"
3. "Click to reveal answer" hint

**BACK of Card:**
1. Full English sentence with target word highlighted: "I will **charge** into battle"
2. 🔊 Play Audio button for text-to-speech

**System Details:**
- Each word gets 5 sample sentences from Gemini with `~word~` markup
- SRS interval determines which sentence is shown (rotating through all 5)
- Cloze deletion format for active recall learning
- Target word highlighting in yellow on back, native language on front
- **CRITICAL**: All flashcards MUST have `exampleSentencesGenerated` field with proper `~word~` markup - no fallback UI exists

## 🚫 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES

### NO FALLBACK UI
**NEVER create fallback UI to paper over missing data or broken functionality!**

- **Always fix the root cause** instead of adding bandaid solutions
- **If data is missing, throw a clear error** instead of showing wrong format
- **No "basic" flashcard formats** - only the proper cloze deletion format
- **If the backend doesn't generate proper data, fix the backend** - don't work around it in frontend
- **Better to crash with a clear error** than to lie to the user with wrong functionality

This prevents technical debt and ensures we actually solve problems instead of hiding them.

### ALWAYS UPDATE README
**EVERY TIME you make changes, update this README with important information for the next AI!**

- **Document UI changes** - new components, button layouts, mode switches
- **Document backend changes** - API endpoints, data formats, validation rules
- **Document bug fixes** - what was broken and how it was fixed
- **Document development patterns** - coding standards, architectural decisions
- **Update system requirements** - new dependencies, environment variables

This ensures continuity and prevents future AIs from repeating mistakes or missing context.

## 📝 RECENT MAJOR CHANGES

### UI Mode Switching (December 2024)
- **Replaced mode dropdown with emoji buttons** in `/polycast-frontend/src/components/Controls.jsx`
- **Button layout**: 📝 Transcript (students in rooms only), 📚 Dictionary, 🔄 Flashcard
- **Smart visibility**: Only show buttons for modes you're NOT currently in
- **Transcript button logic**: Only appears for students when actually in a room (requires `roomSetup` prop)
- **Location**: Top controls bar, next to profile selector

### Backend Flashcard Generation (December 2024)
- **Fixed Gemini preamble issue**: Added cleanup patterns to strip "Here's the output:" from responses
- **Enhanced validation**: Backend now validates proper `~word~` markup and throws clear errors
- **Improved Gemini prompt**: More explicit structure requiring exactly 12 parts with concrete example
- **Better error logging**: Detailed logging of failed responses for debugging
- **Location**: `/polycast-backend/server.js` lines 915-975

### Flashcard Error Handling (December 2024)
- **Removed all fallback UI** that showed basic word format instead of proper cloze deletion
- **Clear error throwing**: Components now fail clearly when `exampleSentencesGenerated` is missing
- **Fixed session completion logic**: Only shows completion screen after reviewing cards, not when starting empty
- **Improved no-cards message**: Clear numbered instructions on how to add words via Dictionary Mode and transcript clicking
- **Localized instructions**: No-cards message now displays in user's native language (Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese)
- **Affected files**: `FlashcardMode.jsx`, `MobileFlashcardMode.jsx`, `useFlashcardSession.js`

- **Card Types**: New cards, learning cards, review cards
- **Frequency-Based Sorting**: New cards sorted by word frequency (10 = most common)
- **Due Date Management**: Automatic scheduling based on performance
- **Session Limits**: Configurable daily new card limits

### 4. Flashcard System (Cloze Deletion Format)
- **Card Front**: English sentence with target word blanked out (e.g., "I will _____ into battle") + full translation with target word highlighted in native language
- **Card Back**: Full English sentence with target word highlighted in yellow + text-to-speech audio
- **Generated Content**: Each word gets 5 example sentences from Gemini API with ~word~ markup
- **Rotation System**: SRS interval determines which of the 5 sentences is shown
- **Touch Gestures** (Mobile): Swipe left (wrong), swipe right (correct), tap to flip
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded responses, smooth animations
- **Audio Integration**: Text-to-speech playback for pronunciation practice
- **Progress Tracking**: Session statistics and learning analytics

### 5. Profile Management
- **Multiple Profiles**: Cat, Dog, Mouse, Horse, Lizard + Non-saving mode
- **Data Persistence**: Individual progress tracking per profile
- **Cloud Sync**: Automatic backup of flashcard progress
- **Non-saving Mode**: Temporary sessions with hardcoded cards for testing
